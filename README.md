# Large Scale Scheduler

### Organizational matters
* We're having a video conference every Monday at 19:00.

### Technical matters
* The code is written in __C++14__.
* We adhere to [__Google C++ Style Guide__](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html).
* We use __GoogleTest__. Code without proper tests cannot be
  pushed to master.
* The project is built with __CMake__.
* We use __Bitbucket issue tracker__.
* The code is documented by comments in sources and __README.md__ files
  in project directories.
* Code is being developed in separate __feature branches__ and regularly merged
  into master.
* To merge a branch into master the code __must be reviewed__ by another person,
  it must have sufficent test coverage and all the tests have to pass.
